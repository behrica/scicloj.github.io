-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Unlike most Scicloj projects, this one is not focused on Clojure. It is an online study group about probabilistic modelling, open to people of diverse technical backgrounds.

As of Feb. 2022, we are still checking the possibility of organizing this group, hoping to decide and possibly begin in the coming weeks. 

Your response to :star: [the survey](https://bit.ly/scicloj-probmod-group-survey) :star: would help a lot in our planning.

The details below are tentative and will probably change following your feedback and community discussions.

## Agenda

We will begin by learning one introductory book, probably [Think Bayes 2](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/) by Allen B. Downey.

Then, we will proceed with more advanced books and articles.

This field of statistics is tightly related to programming, and during our learning we will look into different languages and libraries for Bayesian computing and probabilistic programming.

In parallel to the main path of learning, we will encourage individual and small-group projects, and will continuously share our progress with each other.

## Sessions

We will meet once in two weeks to learn together for two hours.
The first hour will be dedicated to following our main path of study (e.g., the current book chapter being read). 
In the second hour, we will share our progress with the projects, and explore further.

In between these main sessions, we will encourage ad-hoc sessions to explore specialized topics or practice further.

## Recordings

Some parts of the sessions will be recorded and shared with the group. Possibly, some parts of the recordings will be made public.

## Projects

Participants will take on projects as individuals or small groups.

Example project:
* read an article and share it with the group
* reimplement an example we've learned using a different programming language or different library 
* explore a dataset with the methods learned

## Assumed background

We will probably assume some background in programming, math, and statistics.
The assumptions here will depend on your feedback on the survey and community discussions.

## Principles

The following core principles are typical to Scicloj study groups.

**No experts**. We do not assume that anybody in the group is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset. 

**A clear path**. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and about where we wish to go. We will continuously rethink and adapt our path going there.

**Confused together**. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.

**Being active**. The group encourages its members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.

**Mutual curiosity**. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.

## Why is Scicloj organizing this Group

Scicloj is an open-source group working on a stack of tools and libraries for data science using the Clojure programming language.

A few of us care a lot about the probabilistic/Bayesian paradigm and find it a promising approach in general

Moreover, We believe there are some common core ideas in common between Clojure, the programming language, and Bayesian Statistics, the scientific method. They both seek simple, coherent, and conceptually clear solutions to problems, and they both dare to diverge from mainstream approaches in order to achieve that.

The Scicloj approach to building a data science stack is based on building bridges to other languages and ecosystems. This seems compatible with the spirit of the Bayesian community and its subcommunities, where different technological flavors respect and learn from each other.

Creating a polyglot study group -- one where different programming languages and styles of thinking meet to learn together -- is also a way to challenge ourselves to learn more about other ecosystems, and hopefully encourage friends from those ecosystems to be curious about Clojure.
