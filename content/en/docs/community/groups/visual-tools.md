* Meeting 1 - the beginning (Feb. 4th 2022) - [summary & video](https://clojureverse.org/t/visual-tools-meeting-1-summary-video/).
* Meeting 2 - compatibility across tools (Feb. 19th 2022) - [summary & video](https://clojureverse.org/t/visual-tools-meeting-2-summary-video/)
* Meeting 3 - general montlhy meeting (Mar. 5th 2022) - [summary & video](https://clojureverse.org/t/visual-tools-meeting-3-summary-video/)
