This page describes the plans for a new online study group planned to start in Fall 2022, around the topics of probabilistic modelling and Bayesian computing.

Even though the group is initiated by Scicloj -- a community for data science in Clojure -- this study group will not be focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it will be open to people of diverse technical backgrounds, and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.

The details below are tentative.

## Meetings

* 2022-07-22, initial brainstorming - [event](https://bit.ly/jointprob-brainstorm-1)

## Joining

To join the group and receive updates, please email us: <a href="mailto:scicloj@gmail.com">scicloj@gmail.com</a>. It'd be nice to mention your name, and as much as you wish, tell a bit about your background and interests.

There is no need to do that if you have already received emails about this group, if you have responded to our survey, or if you have registered to the initial brainstorming meeting.

## Chat

The group uses Zulip, an open-source chat platform. In some other groups we've been running, we've found it useful for chat, in-depth discussion threads, and knowledge management.

Our Zulip organization is [jointprob.zulipchat.com](https://jointprob.zulipchat.com/).

You may wish to learn a little bit about the concepts of [Zulip streams and topics](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics). Note that all streams and topics (and even single messages) have URLs, that you can open at separate tabs in your browser.

If you wish, it would be wonderful to present yourself at the [personal intros](https://jointprob.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/331546-personal-intros) stream, preferably as a new topic thread.

## Agenda

We will begin by learning one introductory book. It will probably be [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919/) by Richard McElreath.

Then, we will proceed with more advanced books and articles.

Bayesian statistics is tightly related to programming, and during our learning we will look into different programming languages and libraries.

In parallel to the main path of learning, we will encourage individual and small-group projects, and will share our progress with each other.

## Sessions

We will meet once in two weeks to learn together for two hours.
The first hour will be dedicated to following our main path of study (e.g., the current book chapter being read).
In the second hour, we will share our progress with the projects, and explore further.

In between these main sessions, we will encourage ad-hoc sessions to explore specialized topics or practice further.

## Groups

Our regular sessions take place in groups:

| group | start date | time in [UTC time zone](https://time.is/UTC) |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Aug. 15th  | Mon 15:00 UTC                                |
| **B** | Aug. 17th  | Wed 14:00 UTC                                |
| **C** | Aug. 19th  | Fri 18:00 UTC                                |
| **D** | Aug. 20th  | Sat 17:00 UTC                                |

* All groups meet every 2 weeks and follow roughly the same reading agenda.
* Hopefully, each one of us can usually attend one group (but is encouraged to join more sessions if comfortable).
* A typical session (~90 minutes) will have a brief overview of the relevant chapter(s) presented by a group member, and then a mostly a hands-on dive into examples, and a discussion.
* Group sessions will be recorded and shared internally in Zulip. Some parts (e.g., chapter overviews) can be made public on youtube.
* Each group will have its own rotation of moderators and presenters.

## Recordings

Some parts of the sessions will be recorded and shared with the group. Some parts will also be made public.

## Projects

Participants will take on projects as individuals or in small groups.

Example projects:
* read an article and share it with the group
* reimplement an example we've learned using a different technology
* explore a dataset with the methods learned

## Assumed background

We will probably assume some basic background in programming, math, and statistics.
This will be made more precise soon.

## Principles

The following core principles are typical to Scicloj study groups.

**No experts**. We do not assume that anybody in the group is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset.

**A clear path**. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and about where we wish to go. We will continuously rethink and adapt our path going there.

**Confused together**. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.

**Being active**. The group encourages its members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.

**Mutual curiosity**. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.
