*(this group is on hold)*

The ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings for practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.

It has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.

**Organizer**: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the [Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/))

**Chat stream**: [#ml-study](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study)
