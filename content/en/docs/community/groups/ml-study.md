*(this group is on hold, as of Feb. 2022 -- hoping to come back in the near future)*

The ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings about practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.

It has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.

**Organizer**: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the [Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/))

**Typical time of meetings**: on hold at the moment

**Chat stream**: [#ml-study](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study)
