*(this group is on hold)*

The sicmutils group has been studying the [Sicmutils](https://github.com/sicmutils/sicmutils) computer algebra system and the [SICM](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics) book, and discussing various projects by group members around the topics of math and physics in Clojure.

Its explorations have affected the development of some of our tools and libraries for data-visualization and literate programming, among other things.

**Organizer**: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the [Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/))

**Typical time of meetings**: ad hoc meetings by group members' initiatives

**Chat stream**: [#sicmutils](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/267174-sicmutils)
