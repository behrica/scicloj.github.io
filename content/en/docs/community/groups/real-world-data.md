The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for real-world data problems.

The goal is to create a space where individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations are able to share their experiences in using Clojure for data-centric projects. Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.

We want it to be a safe space, that would be comfortable for sharing successes, troubles, problems, hopes, and doubts. We want it to be useful not only for those who use mostly Clojure but also for those who are curious-but-doubtful.

**Future**: 
* Meeting 1 - the beginning (Feb. 25th 2022) - [announcement](https://clojureverse.org/t/real-world-data-meetup-1/)
